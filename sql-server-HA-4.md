# AlwaysOn Availability Groups (2) 
In this lesson, we'll configure AlwaysOn AGs on a three node Windows Server Failover Cluster. We'll first look at the prerequisites for the setup and will then do the following:
- Set up four Hyper-V VMs; one VM will act as a domain controller and the other three will be the availability group replicas

- Set up AlwaysOn AGs
As a part of the AlwaysOn availability setup, we'll also configure a domain controller. In a real-world scenario, configuring a domain controller and Windows Server Failover Cluster is part of a System Administrator's job.
